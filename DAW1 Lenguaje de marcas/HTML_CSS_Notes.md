# HTML5 vs Other Versions

## DOCTYPE
- The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the first in an HTML document, before the <html> tag.
- It is an instruction for the web browser about the HTML version the page is written in.
- HTML5 does not require a reference to a DTD (Document Type Definition), unlike HTML 4.01, which is based on SGML.
- Always include the <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML documents, so the browser knows what type of document to expect.

## Metadata in HTML5
- The `<meta>` tag provides metadata about the HTML document. It doesn’t display on the page, but machines can process it.
- HTML5 has a new attribute, `charset`, making it easier to define the character set: `<meta charset="UTF-8">`.
- HTML5 `<meta>` tag doesn’t require a closing tag, unlike XHTML.

## New Semantic Elements in HTML5
- New semantic elements such as:
    - `<header>`: specifies headers of a document or section.
    - `<nav>`: defines a set of navigation links.
    - `<footer>`: specifies one or more footers.
    - `<article>`: specifies self-contained content (e.g., forum post, newspaper article).
    - `<section>`: groups thematically related content.
    - `<aside>`: content placed to the side of the main content, typically in a sidebar.

## Multimedia Elements in HTML5
- `<audio>` and `<video>` elements allow embedding of audio and video without needing Flash:
```html
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
</audio>
```

# HTML Structure and Tags

## Page Structure
- The basic structure of an HTML page includes:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
- All HTML documents consist of two main parts:
  - Head: Contains metadata and is enclosed in <head> tags.
  - Body: Contains the visible content and is enclosed in <body> tags.

## Block and Inline Elements
- **Block Elements**:
  - Examples: `<div>`, `<p>`, `<section>`.
  - Start on a new line and take up the full width available.
  - Commonly used for structure and layout.
  
- **Inline Elements**:
  - Examples: `<span>`, `<a>`, `<img>`.
  - Do not start on a new line and only take up as much space as needed.

# CSS Fundamentals

## CSS Positioning
- CSS has various positioning methods to control how elements appear on the page:
  - `static`: Default positioning. Elements appear in normal flow.
  - `relative`: Positioned relative to its normal position, using top, bottom, left, or right.
  - `absolute`: Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
  - `fixed`: Positioned relative to the viewport, it stays in place when the page is scrolled.
  - `sticky`: Switches between relative and fixed positioning depending on scroll position.

## Display Property
- `display: block`: Elements are stacked vertically, and the element takes up the full width.
- `display: inline`: Elements are placed inline with others and do not break the line.
- `display: inline-block`: Combines features of block and inline, allowing width and height to be applied but remaining inline.
- `display: none`: Hides the element from the page layout.

# CSS Specificity and Inheritance

## Specificity
- Specificity determines which CSS rules are applied by the browser when multiple rules could apply to the same element.
- The specificity hierarchy is calculated based on the number of IDs, classes, and elements used in the selector.
- Example of specificity calculation:
  - `#id` (100 points) > `.class` (10 points) > `element` (1 point)

## Inheritance
- Some properties in CSS are inherited by child elements (e.g., font-family, color).
- Properties like `background-color` are not inherited by default.
- Inheritance helps to reduce redundancy in CSS by applying a style to a parent element, which is passed to children.

# Flexbox and Grid Layout

## Flexbox
- Flexbox provides a more efficient way to align and distribute space among items in a container.
- Properties such as `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-direction` control the layout.
- Example for centering content:
```css
#container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## CSS Grid
- CSS Grid allows for complex web layouts using rows and columns.
- The `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties define the structure of the grid.
- Example for creating a 3-column grid:
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}
```

# HTML Forms

## Form Elements
- HTML forms collect user input.
- Common form elements include:
  - `<input>`: Defines input controls (text, email, password, etc.).
  - `<textarea>`: Multi-line text input.
  - `<button>`: Submits the form.
  
## Input Types in HTML5
- HTML5 introduced new input types like:
  - `type="email"`: Validates email format.
  - `type="number"`: Accepts numeric input.
  - `type="range"`: Slider input.
  - `type="date"`: Date picker.
